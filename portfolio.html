    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! Welcome to my developer portfolio.
      Here you'll find most of my completed projects from the past few years,
      from full-stack websites to Minecraft mods to Discord bots and everything in-between.
    </p>

    <h2>Websites</h2>
    <p>
      When I first started out as a developer, creating websites always seemed like a daunting task. However, with the
      advent of web frameworks like <a href="https://react.dev/">React</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>, and
      <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>, I've learned that developing a website can be fun and easy, so much so
      that I can now create a small website for a project in only a weekend.
    </p>

        <p class="title">Speedrun VOD Club</p>
        <p class="subtitle">
          Written in Kotlin/Ktor and TypeScript/SvelteKit.

        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Together with my friend <a href="https://dunkyl.net">Dunkyl</a>, we wrote a website that allows you to share
          and watch archived videos of speedruns from charity marathons, like
          <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com">Games Done Quick</a>.
          The backend is written in Kotlin using the Ktor framework.
          The <a href="https://vods.speedrun.club/">web frontend</a> is written in TypeScript using the SvelteKit framework,
          while the <a href="https://reddit.com/u/VODThread">Reddit frontend</a> is written in Kotlin.
          The original 2019 version of this project was written in Python.

        <p class="description">
          HTSea is an April Fool's Day project created by the staff of
          <a href="https://discord.gg/dxCBaYn">HTwins STEM</a> which pokes fun at cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Users were
          able to earn Diamonds, our "cryptocurrency," by mining real diamond ore on our Minecraft server or by solving
          Wordles in their web browser.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          As the project lead, I outlined how exactly the event would work and what all was necessary for our goals to
          be reached. I helped direct team members and provided my assistance with fixing problems in the code. I also
          contributed and developed the Minecraft plugin used to convert diamonds (the item) to Diamonds
          (the "cryptocurrency") and contributed to various other parts of the project.

        <p class="title">Yahoo! Groups Viewer</p>

        </p>
        <p class="description">
          As described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Groups">Wikipedia</a>,
          "Yahoo! Groups was a free-to-use system of electronic mailing lists offered by Yahoo!."
          While archives of this defunct website exist, they are notoriously hard to peruse, effectively resulting in
          messages from these old boards being lost to time. This presented an issue to speedrunning communities,
          particularly the Mario Kart community, who often shared their personal best times to these boards. To help
          resolve this problem, I developed this website to provide an archive of select boards from Yahoo! Groups which
          can all be easily read and searched. The site is backed by a Kotlin (Ktor) backend which serves data from
          files pre-processed by a Python script for rendering by the JavaScript (SvelteKit) web browser frontend.

    <h2>Minecraft</h2>
    <p>
      Crafting unique experiences in this block game has been a large focus of mine for the past few years. From one-off

      <a href="https://papermc.io/">Paper API</a>,
      it's hard to find an aspect of the classic game that I haven't worked with.

    <h2>Discord</h2>
    <p>
      My programming journey has come a long way since my first Discord bot written in C# that was stuffed into one huge file.
      Since then, I've accrued years of experience in developing bots for Discord, particularly with the
      <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">discord.py</a> library, and continue to work on creating my
      own <a href="https://github.com/quasicolon/quasicolon/">batteries-included bot library for Java</a> in my free time.

          configurations, integrates with numerous third-party APIs such as
          <a href="https://perspectiveapi.com/">Perspective</a> to assist with real-time moderation, and features a
