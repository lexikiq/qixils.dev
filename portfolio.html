    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! Welcome to my developer portfolio.
      Here you'll find most of my completed projects from the past few years,
      from Discord bots to Minecraft plugins to full-stack websites and everything in-between.
    </p>

    <h2>Minecraft</h2>
    <p>
      Crafting unique experiences in this block game has been a large focus of mine for the past few years. From one-off
      <a href="https://fabricmc.net/">Fabric mods</a> to entire minigames developed with the
      <a href="https://papermc.io/">Paper API</a>,
      it's hard to find an aspect of the classic game that I haven't worked with.

    <h2>Discord</h2>
    <p>
      My journey of making bots for Discord has come a long way since my first C# bot. That bot was one of my first
      programming projects which was evident from it all being stuffed into one file. Since then, I've accrued years of
      experience in developing bots for Discord, particularly with the
      <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">discord.py</a> library, and continue to work on creating my
      own <a href="https://github.com/quasicolon/quasicolon/">batteries-included bot library for Java</a>
      in my free time.

          Created with <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">discord.py</a>, Semicolon is my
          longstanding passion project. Beginning as a random hodgepodge of commands, this bot quickly evolved into a
          powerful moderation bot used by several large servers. This bot utilizes a SQL database to store per-server
          configurations, numerous third-party APIs such as <a href="https://perspectiveapi.com/">Perspective</a> to
          assist with real-time moderation, and features a robust localization system which allows the bot to be used by
          users who don't speak English.

          from the ground up with first-class support for localization, allowing developers to easily develop bots for a
          wider audience. It also manages common boilerplate such as connecting to and fetching objects from a MongoDB
          server.

          Viewing the schedule of upcoming speedruns during a <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com">Games Done Quick</a>

          2019 to read schedule data from the GDQ API and mirror it to a Discord text channel. Alongside the full event
          schedule, the bot displays a short roster of upcoming runs as well as timestamped links to the start of past
          speedruns using data fetched from contributors on Reddit.

          As described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Groups">Wikipedia</a>,
          "Yahoo! Groups was a free-to-use system of electronic mailing lists offered by Yahoo!."
          While archives of this defunct website exist, they are notoriously hard to peruse, effectively resulting in
          messages from these old boards being lost to time. This presented an issue to speedrunning communities,
          particularly the Mario Kart community, who often shared their personal best times to these boards. To help
          resolve this problem, I developed this website to provide an archive of select boards from Yahoo! Groups which
          can all be easily read and searched. The site is backed by a Kotlin (Ktor) backend which serves data from
          files pre-processed by a Python script for rendering by the JavaScript (SvelteKit) web browser frontend.
